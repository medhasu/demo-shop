# Next.js and GraphQL Demo

This project demonstrates using Next.js with GraphQL to create and fetch
products.

## Getting Started

To run the app locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Implementation

- `data/products.ts` contains a mock data store to manage products
- `v1/graphsql/route.ts` integrates a GraphQL server using Apollo Server Micro
- Components use GraphQL queries to fetch and display products

## Potential Improvements

As this is a demo app, there are several enhancements that could be made:

- Refactor the product data source to integrate with a database like MongoDB or
  DynamoDB for persistence
- Modularize the GraphQL client and server code for improved separation of
  concerns
- Implement performance optimizations like caching and code splitting
- Add authentication and access control for secure data access

## Deployment

This Next.js app can be easily deployed to various platforms:

- Serverless platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS Amplify
- Container hosting services like Heroku
- Any Linux server with Node.js environment

The codebase is production-ready in terms of structure, but would likely require
database integration and performance tuning for a real application.

Overall, this demo provides a good starting point for building a GraphQL-powered
Next.js application.
